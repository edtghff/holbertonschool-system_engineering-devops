When a user wants to access a website, they type “www.foobar.com”
 into their web browser.

1. Domain Resolution

The domain name foobar.com is registered and configured in the DNS.

A DNS A record links the domain to an IP address:

www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8

The purpose of the domain name is to translate a human-readable address into a server IP address.

The “www” record is an A record that maps to an IPv4 address.

2. Single Server Infrastructure (IP Address: 8.8.8.8)

The website is hosted on a single server, which contains all the components required to run the application.

a) Web Server (Nginx)

Nginx receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user’s browser.

It serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

It forwards dynamic requests to the application server for processing.

b) Application Server

The application server runs the website’s application code.

It handles the business logic and processes dynamic requests.

It generates responses such as HTML pages or JSON data.

c) Application Files (Code Base)

The code base contains the source code of the website.

It defines how the application behaves and processes requests.

This code is executed by the application server.

d) Database (MySQL)

The MySQL database stores persistent data, such as users, posts, or other records.

The application server communicates with the database to read and write data.

3. Communication Flow

The user’s computer communicates with the server using HTTP/HTTPS over TCP.

Nginx communicates internally with the application server.

The application server connects to the MySQL database through a local connection.

4. Definitions

Server: A machine that provides services or resources to clients over a network.

Domain name: Converts a readable website name into an IP address.

Web server: Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests.

Application server: Executes application logic and generates dynamic content.

Database: Stores structured and persistent data.

5. Limitations of This Infrastructure
a) Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

All components run on the same server.

If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

b) Downtime During Maintenance

Maintenance tasks such as deploying new code, restarting services, or updating the system cause downtime.

There is no redundancy to keep the website online during these operations.

c) Lack of Scalability

A single server cannot handle high traffic efficiently.

Hardware resources such as CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and database capacity are limited.

There is no load balancing or horizontal scaling implemented.
